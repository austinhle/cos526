  <h2 class="cs">Overview</h2>

  <p>In this assignment, I implement the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) algorithm
  for registration of point clouds. Using a provided set of 3D point cloud scans
  and a given set of initial guesses for their transformations, the algorithm
  pairwise aligns the point clouds by computing new transformations that minimize
  pairwise point cloud distances. If the initial transformation guesses are
  sufficiently "close enough", the algorithm will converge to produce a single,
  cohesively aligned point cloud representing the entire, original 3D surface.</p>

  <h2 class="cs">Implementation</h2>

  <h3 class="cs">User-defined Libraries and Classes</h3>

  <p>To implement the Iterative Closest Points algorithm, I first designed and
  implemented several different libraries and classes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>Point</tt> (<code>point.h, point.cpp</code>): A point in 3D Cartesian space.
      Stores point coordinates as well as normal vector. Supports transformations.</li>
    <li><tt>PointCloud</tt> (<code>pointcloud.h, pointcloud.cpp</code>):
      A point cloud of points in 3D Cartesian space. Supports nearest neighbor
      search via brute-force linear search or kd-tree search and can return a
      random subset of its points.</li>
    <li><tt>KDTree</tt> (<code>kdtree.h, kdtree.cpp</code>): A k-dimensional tree
      for storing points in 3D Cartesian space. Supports simple insertion and
      nearest neighbor methods.</li>
    <li><tt>Matrix4x4</tt> (<code>matrix4x4.h, matrix4x4.cpp</code>):
      A non-generalized implementation of a 4x4 matrix and some simple operations,
      including addition, subtraction, multiplication by vector and matrix, division,
      determinant, inverse, and constructors for specific translation and rotation
      matrices used in rigid-body transformations. Used to represent a point cloud's
      affine transformation from its own coordinate space into world space.</li>
    <li><tt>Matrix6x6</tt> (<code>matrix6x6.h, matrix6x6.cpp</code>):
      A non-generalized implementation of a 6x6 matrix and some simple operations,
      including addition, subtraction, multiplication by vector and matrix, and
      division. Does not support other operations, and is only used for formulating
      and solving the 6x6 linear system of equations in the ICP algorithm.</li>
    <li><tt>Vector3D</tt> (<code>vector3D.h, vector3D.cpp</code>):
      A 3-dimensional vector supporting simple operations, including addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division, dot product, and cross product. Used
      to represent a Point's coordinates as well as its normal vector, and perform
      math at a higher level of abstraction.</li>
    <li><tt>Vector4D</tt> (<code>vector4D.h, vector4D.cpp</code>):
      A 4-dimensional vector supporting simple operations, including addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division, and dot product. Used to represent
      a Point in homogenous coordinates so that an affine transformation can
      be performed by a simple matrix-vector multiplication.</li>
    <li><tt>Vector6D</tt> (<code>vector6D.h, vector6D.cpp</code>):
      A 46dimensional vector supporting simple operations, including addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division, and dot product. It is used only
      alongside <tt>Matrix6x6</tt> for formulating and solving a 6x6 linear
      system of equations in the ICP algorithm.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Side note:</b> The implementations of the matrix and vector libraries
  were inspired by a similar assignment that I previously did in my undergraduate
  computer graphics course and then later improved upon when I TA'd for the class.
  I realized shortly after that I had already implemented a good portion
  of the libraries that I could probably have just used the (most certainly better)
  matrix and vector libraries included in the GNU Scientific Library, rather than
  using GSL only for the linear solver.</p>

  <h3 class="cs">The Iterative Closest Points Program</h3>

  <p>Using the above libraries, I then composed <code>icp.cpp</code>, which
  is the program's entry point. This file contains code for solving a linear
  system of equations using LU decomposition from the GNU Scientific Library.
  In its main function, it performs the 13 steps outlined in the provided
  assignment specification. During execution, the program's progress is sent
  to standard output, and overall time consumed is reported at the end.</p>

  <h3 class="cs">Efficiency</h3>

  <p>The initial implementation of the algorithm used a brute-force linear search
  through the entire point cloud to find the nearest neighbor. For the provided
  point clouds, this process was not terribly slow. However, after I added an
  additional kd-tree data structure for logarithmic nearest neighbor search,
  performance improved significantly. On average, I noted a 3-5x improvement in
  time for the provided point clouds, in exchange for some pre-processing to
  create the kd-tree and the space to store it.</p>

  <h3 class="cs">Problems I ran into...</h3>

  <p>For a while, I could not figure out why the mean point-to-plane distance
  would immediately increase after a single iteration (and consequently
  terminate the algorithm). I ran the program several times on the same two
  point clouds, and noticed that my two point clouds were slowly moving
  further and further apart from each other with each run. After some debugging
  and discussion with other students, I found that the formulation of the
  Y-rotation matrix from the reference slides had a typo: the angle was not
  negated properly! A quick change in negative signs quickly resolved the issue.</p>

  <br><hr>

  <h2 class="cs">Results</h2>

  <p>I performed the pairwise alignment of point cloud scans as suggested
  in the assignment spec:</p>

  <p><tt>
  ./icp bun045.pts bun000.pts<br/>
  ./icp bun090.pts bun045.pts<br/>
  ./icp bun315.pts bun000.pts<br/>
  ./icp bun270.pts bun315.pts<br/>
  ./icp bun180.pts bun270.pts<br/>
  ./icp chin.pts bun315.pts<br/>
  ./icp ear_back.pts bun180.pts<br/>
  ./icp top2.pts bun180.pts<br/>
  ./icp top3.pts bun000.pts
  </tt></p>

  <p>Then, <tt>pts_view *.pts</tt> resulted in a beautifully aligned point cloud
    of a bunny! Here are a few different angles of the final result.</p>

  <h2 class="cs">Future Work & Learnings</h2>
  <p>Being a somewhat involved assignment with the chance to implement some
  of my own libraries, I was able to continue to hone my skills in good C++
  programming and style. Although I spent some time adhering to Google's
  C++ Style Guide, I am sure that there is still a lot that can be done to
  improve the overall modularity, design, and readability of this project.</p>

  <p>In the future, I would like to revisit the project to continue cleaning up
  the code and improve its overall design and clarity as much as possible. In
  addition, I would most likely also remove my own matrix and vector libraries
  in favor of using more robust ones, such as those written in the GNU
  scientific library.</p>

  <br><hr>

  <h2 class="cs">Usage</h2>

  <h3 class="cs">Dependencies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GSL (GNU Scientific Library)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="cs">Building with Makefile</h3>

  <p>From the root directory, use the provided Makefile to build the program.
  </p>

  <p><code>$ make</code></p>

  <h3 class="cs">Execution</h3>

  <p>The program is then run from the command line with 2 additional arguments:</p>

  <p><code>$ ./icp src.pts dst.pts</code></p>

  <p>The program expects that the point cloud (.pts) files and their corresponding
  transformation (.xf) files are in the same directory. It will not recursively
  search for the files in a nested subdirectory. Given <code>src.pts</code> and
  <code>dst.pts</code>, the program loads up the transformation files
  <code>src.xf</code> and <code>dst.xf</code> from the same local directory.</p>

  <p>After aligning <code>src.pts</code> and <code>dst.pts</code>, the provided
  <code>pts_view</code> program can be run to view the two point clouds, which
  should now be aligned.</p>

  <p><code>$ ./pts_view src.pts dst.pts</code></p>
