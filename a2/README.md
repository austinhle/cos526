# Assignment 2: Point Cloud Registration

In this assignment, I implement the Iterative Closest Points algorithm
to align various point clouds into a single, consistent point cloud.

This algorithm is used to reconstruct 3D surfaces from multiple point-cloud
scans of the surface captured from different angles.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point.
