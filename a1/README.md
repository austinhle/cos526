# Assignment 1: Poisson Image Editing

In this assignment, I implement the seamless cloning algorithm and several
additional extensions from the [Poisson Image Editing paper by Perez et al.](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos526/papers/perez03.pdf).

This algorithm allows us to seamlessly blend a region from a source image into
a destination image with minimal perceivable artifacts to the human eye.

For more information, please see the [assignment specification].
